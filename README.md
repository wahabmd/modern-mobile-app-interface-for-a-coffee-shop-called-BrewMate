I created a sleek, modern mobile app interface for a coffee shop called BrewMate, focusing on delivering an intuitive and visually appealing user experience. The design aims to capture the essence of the brand while making it easy for users to explore, select, and order their favorite coffee.

Key highlights of the design:

A vibrant splash screen to create an inviting first impression.
A welcome screen that sets the mood with smooth curves and minimalist branding.
A user-friendly menu interface with bold visuals and an easy-to-navigate structure.
Clean and detailed product screens for an enhanced browsing and shopping experience.
Alternate design options to showcase variations in layout and color schemes for user flexibility.
